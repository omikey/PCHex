# PCHex
3DS Homebrew port of PKHex, A Pokémon save editor.

Currently just proof of concept.

# Build
You need the latest git version of ctrulib, found here: https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib
as this will NOT work with devkitPro's base ctrulib.

# Install
Copy the content of the "export" folder in your "homebrew" or "3ds" folder.

# Use
* Choose PCHex from the homebrew browser
* Choose your Pokémon game as the target game
* Follow Instructions
* Select to export your changes
